# ProjectEuler
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help  arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

This repository contains my solutions to these problems. Only problems which had a runtime of less than 60 seconds are shown here. The package Useful_Functions_PE contains functions that are used across multiple solutions, mainly regarding Prime Numbers, Fibonacci Sequence, etc. Functions for primes have been optimized by the use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes and upper bound for the possible value of the Nth prime. No such optimization has been done yet for Fibonacci.
